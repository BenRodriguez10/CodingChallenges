# Adapter Pattern Challenge

## Scenario

You are a developer within a company that wishes to automate the payment of its employees.

Your company already uses a HR system to keep track of its employees, their salaries and their payment details.
Currently, someone in HR has to go through the employees in the HR system and send out monthly salaries manually
at the end of each month.

Your company has decided to invest in a payment system that will allow them to automate this. As the developer, it
is your job to automate this flow so that the people in HR don't have to do these manual tasks each month.

## Things to be mindful of

* The different systems allow you to have access to their source code and documentation. However, this is on a
read-only basis.
* The HR system stores employee base salaries for the year, but you are automating a monthly process

## Bonus points
